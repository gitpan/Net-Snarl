NAME
    Net::Snarl - Snarl network protocol

SYNOPSIS
      use Net::Snarl;

      # connect to localhost and register Net::Snarl application
      my $snarl = Net::Snarl->register('Net::Snarl');
      $snarl->add_class('Test'); # add Test notification class
      $snarl->notify('Test', 'Hello', 'World', 5); # show hello world for 5 seconds

DESCRIPTION
    A simple interface to send Snarl notifications across the network. Snarl
    must be running on the target machine.

INTERFACE
  register($application, $host, $port)
    Connects to Snarl and register an application. Host defaults to
    localhost and port defaults to $Net::Snarl::SNARL_PORT.

  add_class($class, $title)
    Registers a notification class with your application. Title is the
    optional friendly name for the class.

  notify($class, $title, $text, $timeout, $icon)
    Displays a notification of the specified class. Timeout defaults to 0
    (sticky) and icon defaults to nothing.

BUGS
    Please report and bugs or feature requests on GitHub
    <https://github.com/bentglasstube/Net-Snarl/issues>

TODO
    Later versions of Snarl report interactions with the notifications back
    to the socket. Currently these are stored in a private queue.
    Eventually, I will expose an interface for triggering callbacks on these
    events but that will most likely require threading so I'm a little
    reluctant to implement it.
